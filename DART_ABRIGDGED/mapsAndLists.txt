Map & Hashmap -> key order is the same as key insertion
HashMap -> no key order in any way (performance++)
SplayMap -> key order is rising (alphabetical/numeric/whatever used to compare)
	lowest first highest last (not making a drug reference this time)
Set -> list of unique items only

to check if collection is empty or not:
	isEmpty/isNotEmpty -> gigachad dart user
	.length/!collection.isEmpty -> beta javahead

CONFUSING THING WITH list.map
	you can do list.map()
		it's equivalent to java's stream api's list.stream.map(() => {});
		it creates a new map
	it's NOT the same as list.toMap()
	it CREATES a new LIST
	it DOES  NOT turn a list into a map

you can put conditionals directly in your lists ex:
	list = [1,2,3, if (something's true) 4, if (something's false) 5, etc.]
you can also stock functions in a list
	list = [Functoin1, Function2, Function3]

you can also:
	check if every element is something:
		list.every((element) => element > 0);
	create lists this way:
		List<int>.filled(5/*indexes*/,1/*values in the indexes*/);
			fills list of 5 elements with values of 1
		List<int>.generate(10, (index) => index + index);
			creates list of even numbers

reduce and fold basically reduces list into a single value
	useful for calculation your grades and other stuff
	reduce can't be used on empty lists with
		functions that return the same type as the stuff in the collection
	fold can be used on everything basically, even empty stuff

spread operator ...list
	basically takes the elements of the ilsts instead of the list itself
	so instead of taking [1,1,1,1,1,1]
		it takes 1 and 1 and 1 and 1 and 1 and 1 individually
