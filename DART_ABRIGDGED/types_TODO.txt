var
	can change stuff, like any variable, but once the type is set, it's set
final
	final assigns the slot, you cannot change who's assigned
		but you can change the assigned object's attributes
	basically, like reserving a spot for a haircut after it's assigned
		can't change the time for the haircut
		can change the hairstyle, iykwim
const
	constant, can't change shit
let
	better than var
String
	assigns the set
dynamic
	you can change the variabe's type in runtime





when -> var yourVariable = const someUnchangeableValue;
		basically assign yourVariable's slot to someUnchangeableValue;
			you can always change who's assigned to the slot
			you cannot change their values

oki so, usually, it's like this:
	var variable = var value;
		but the var in "var value" is silent

but then, you can be like:
	var variable = const value1;
	var varibale = final value2;
		you can change if variable's value is gonna be value is gonna be
			value1 or value2
		but you cannot be like:
			value1 = urMum or value2 = jaskhfejfusahf
		I hope that made sense
