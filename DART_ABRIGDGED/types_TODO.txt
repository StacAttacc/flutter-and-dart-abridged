var
	can change stuff, like any variable, but once the type is set, it's set
final
	final assigns the slot, you cannot change who's assigned
		but you can change the assigned object's attributes
	basically, like reserving a spot for a haircut after it's assigned
		can't change the time for the haircut
		can change the hairstyle, iykwim
const
	constant, can't change shit
let
	better than var
String
	assigns the set
dynamic
	you can change the variabe's type in runtime
	use "as" to tell dynamic wtf it is
		dynamic variable = thing as OtherThing
late SomeType
	"late" tells them: "trust bro, I'll assign it later"
SomeType?
	"?" means the variable is nullable/can be null
	you can't assign this variable to one that can't be null tho, so be careful
SomeType!
	"!" tells them: "it's null rn, but trus bro, it won't be when you use it"
	you NEED to assign a value to it before you use it
		or the computer is gonna crashout on your lazy ass
SomeType??
	"??" baically checks if stuff is null
	variable??= value means if variable is null, pull value in it
	variable?? otherVariable means:
		if variable is not null, use variable
		if variable is null, use otherVariable
num
	could be an int or a double
		can put a int into a num
		can put double into a num
		cannot put a num in a int
		cannot put a double into num
			num -> slutty top (exclusively)
			int & double -> bottoms
null
	you CAN declare stuff as null because why tf not








when doing a long text, you can
	String stuff = """
		wow
		this
		text
		is
		really
		long
	"""
when adding strings instead of:
	"jasdkfuha sdfiuhadf liuahsf" + number.toString(); <- beta javahead
	do:
	"jasdkfuha sdfiuhadf liuahsf ${s1}"; <- gigachad dart user

also, use StringBuffer instead of String if you planon chaning a string a lot

do print(r"\n \u12312") to tell them no don't interpret the special characters








when -> var yourVariable = const someUnchangeableValue;
		basically assign yourVariable's slot to someUnchangeableValue;
			you can always change who's assigned to the slot
			you cannot change their values

oki so, usually, it's like this:
	var variable = var value;
		but the var in "var value" is silent

but then, you can be like:
	var variable = const value1;
	var varibale = final value2;
		you can change if variable's value is gonna be value is gonna be
			value1 or value2
		but you cannot be like:
			value1 = urMum or value2 = jaskhfejfusahf
		I hope that made sense
