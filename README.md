All ye who attend this class, welcome to thine salvation!

I am aware that dart and flutter is confusing especially when you've just started learning it, BUT FEAR NOT FOR I AM HERE TO HELP!

For context, I've failed this class about 2 times and do not intend to retake it again! I also want to avoid you the same fate.

In order to achieve that goal, I've decided to:

    -take all that can be learned from the teacher's class notes and put them in a simpler, easier to understand format (imo)
    -give little tips and tricks to make coding more enjoyable
    -explain why things work the way they do
    -make little cheatsheets for the basics of flutter and dart

Why am I doing this? boredom, professionally undiagnosed autism, spite and success

Is this free? yes, all the best things are, I love free stuff

!!DISCLAIMER!! I may not update this for future versions of flutter/dart and it may not be 100% accurate, but it will help

welcome:)
(also there might be some swearing, I probably won't edit those out, self expression and shit)
