user can select a value from a continuous range
by using a slider

Slider(
	value: _sliderValue,
		the current value being selected by the slider

	min: 0.0,
		minimum value of the slider

	max: 100.0, 
		maximum value for the slider

	divisions: 10,
		basically slider, but with bumps if that makes sense
		instead of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,8,9,10,11
		you do 0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100

	label: '$_sliderValue',
		basically what you put on the slider
		usually the slider's value

	onChanged: (newValue) {
		setState(() {
			_slideralue = newValue;
		})
	},
		basically what happens when you slide the slider
		don't forget the setState to make the system recognize
		change
)
