you can use this to stack widgets on top of each other like sardines
or to position a widget specifically at some spot in a container

Stack(
	children: [
		Container(color: Colors.blue, width: 100, height: 100),
    		Container(color: Colors.red, width: 80, height: 80),
	],
		list of widgets what will be on top of each other
		the lists's order determines their stacking order
		last one in tops

	alignment: Alignment./*topLeft,center,you already know*/
		used to align the list thingys

	overflow: Overflow./*clip,visible*/
		when it overflows,
		do you want to clip it or let the world see?
		your preferences, I won't judge

	fit: StackFit./*loose,expand*/,
		determines how non-positioned items are resized
		in the stack

	textDirection: TextDirection./*ltr,rtl*/
		either left to right or right to left
