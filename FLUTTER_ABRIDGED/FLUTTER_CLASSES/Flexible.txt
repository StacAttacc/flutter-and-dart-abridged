used in Rows and Columns to control how the items occupy space
similar to Expanded, but givs more flexibility, yup

Row(
	children: [
		Flexible(
			flex: 2,
				how much space is allocated for the item

			child: Container(color: Colors.blue),
				item that will be flexibly sized with
				the flex

			fit: FlexFit./*tight,loose*/
				how the widget should adapt the space
				if it can't be flexibly sized

    		),
    		Flexible(
      			flex: 1,
      			child: Container(color: Colors.red),
    		),
  	],
)
