it just displays its children in a vertical way

Column(
	children: <Widget>[],
		the column's children, coud be any other class if I 				recall correctly
	
	crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAllignment./*start center or end*/,
		where it'll put the children

	mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize./*a size, usually*/,
		how much space should be occupied in the main axis
		decide what to do with the size of the children
		decide what to do with the extra space after the children
		
	
	textBaseline: TextBaseline./*type of baseline*/,
		basically the vertical allignment of the text

	textDirection: TextDirection./*ltr or rtl*/
		some languages are read right to left,
		pthers are read left to right, this helps with that

	verticalDirection: VerticalDirection./*downor up*/
		usually the children go from top to bottom
		with this, you can make the go from the bottom to the top
			drake be like
