to display a scrollable list of children on one axis
basically your tiktok fyp, but could be horizonal

ListView(
	children: [
		ListTile(title: Text('stuff')),
	],
		the stuff inside listview
		the tiktok videos to your fyp
		the comments to your comment section

	shrinkWrap: /*true,false*/,
		basically to determine if it should adjust it's
		size to fit it's children
		like tearing off your backseats to have more cargo space
		I bet some people do it
		I don't
		I take the bus

	scrollDirection: Axis./*horizontal,vertical*/
		basially vertical for vertical scroll like your fyp
		horizontal for idk, your fyp but sideways?
		Idk never really seen horizontal scrolling before
		other than in class

	physics: /*there's too much here might save it for later*/
)


callback function to generate the children on demand
not my words, I don't like the way devs call their shit
ListView.builder(
	itemCount: 100,
	itemBuilder: (context, index) {
		return ListTile(title: Text('Item $index'));
	}
)
