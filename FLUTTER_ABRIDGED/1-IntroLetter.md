Good fellows,

Flutter is confusing as fuck (at first).
This folder contains a list of flutter stuff you will use at some point.
It also contains a bit of advice to make coding less painful
    (it literally gave me a headache at some point).
On top of that, I will try to give examples on how to use their stuff.

For long explanations, I will put a tl;dr in the beginning in case reading isn't exactly your thing (same).

May thine gods guide thee onto the path to pass this class!

!!DISCLAIMER!!
    -There is swearing in these documents
    -I will not apologize for the swearing
    -There's also a lot of "ThAt'S wHaT sHe SaId" thingys
    -I will not apologize for them either
    -For me to be comfortable and do this properly, I need them ;-;
