Good fellows,

Flutter is confusing as fuck (at first)
This folder contains a list of flutter stuff you will use at some point
It also contains a bit of advice to make coding less painful
    (it literally gave me a headache at some point)
On top of that, I will try to give examples on how to use this stuff

May thine gods guide thee onto the path to pass this class
(I will not apologize for the swearing)
